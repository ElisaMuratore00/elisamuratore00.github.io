> Lecturer for the university short-course “Self-exciting temporal point processes: a deep dive into the statistics of Hawkes processes” for second-year students from the Master in Mathematics for Data Science.


Course description
======
In our increasingly data-driven world, understanding temporal patterns has become essential. From the ebb and flow of financial markets to the viral spread of social media trends, from the unpredictable nature of seismic activity to the intricate firing patterns of neurons in the brain, events unfold over time, often influencing and being influenced by one another. This course delves into the the captivating world of Hawkes Processes, a powerful tool to model and analyze such intricate temporal dynamics.

In these lectures, I will guide you through the foundamental concepts of temporal point processes and their characterisation of their conditional intensity function. Then, I will introduce the concept of Hawkes process, starting with its definition and its statistical properties, and moving to the parameter estimation via the maximum likelihood estimation and the expectation maximisation algorithm. Next, I will give an overview of marked temporal point processes, an extension of temporal point processes carrying additional information of events’ occurence. Then, we will conclude the discussion with mutually-exciting Hawkes processes, systems where different types of events mutually trigger each other, capturing the essence of self-reinforcing dynamics.
