> **Applied Mathematician**, interested in employing mathematical models, statistics and data analysis to investigate real-world phenomena, especially in the context of disinformation and coordinated inauthentic behaviour.

Short Bio
------

Hi, welcome to my personal website (WIP)! :D  

I am Elisa Muratore, a mathematician exploring the digital world. Currently, I am a **PhD Candidate** at the University of Trento and Bruno Kessler Foundation in Trento, Italy.  

My research sits at the intersection of **statistics, mathematical models and machine learning**. In particular, 
I am interested in applying these fields to investigate complex real-world challenges, with a primary focus on detecting **disinformation** and coordinated inauthentic behaviour on social media.  

Before diving into my PhD in November 2025, I had the privilege of working with various research teams and projects across different institutions: **Complex Human Behaviour Lab** (FBK) as a research assistant, **University of Trento** as a visitor scholar, and **Aalto University** as a research collaborator in Helsinki, Finland.
