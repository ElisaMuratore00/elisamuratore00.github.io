> Applied Mathematician, interested in employing mathematical models, statistics and data analysis to investigate real-world phenomena, especially in the context of disinformation and coordinated inauthentic behaviour.

Short Bio
------

I am a research assistant in the Complex Human Behaviour Lab from Digital Society department in Bruno Kessler Foundation (Trento, Italy), a visitor in the University of Trento (Trento, Italy) and a soon-to-be PhD candidate within the 41st cycle (starting in November 2025).

I have a Bachelor degree in Mathematics (2019-2022) and a Master degree in Mathematics for Data Science (2022-2024) from the university of Trento. Under the supervision of Prof. Claudio Agostinelli (UNITN), Prof. Mikko Kivel√§ (AALTO) and PHD Letizia Iannucci (AALTO), I started my master's thesis research in AALTO university and, once back, continued in Fondazione Bruno Kessler with the supervision of Researcher Riccardo Gallotti (FBK). In October 2024, I graduated with a thesis entitled "Marked Temporal Point Processes for simulating and capturing coordinated behaviour campaigns: A model for enhancing disinformation detection".

My research interests include statistics, machine learning and mathematical models, and employing these subjects to investigate real-world phenomena, especially in the context of disinformation and coordinated inauthentic behaviour.
