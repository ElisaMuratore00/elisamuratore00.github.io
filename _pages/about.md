> Applied Mathematician, interested in employing mathematical models, statistics and data analysis to investigate real-world phenomena, especially in the context of disinformation and coordinated inauthentic behaviour.

Short Bio
------

I am a **research assistant in the Complex Human Behaviour Lab** from Digital Society department in Bruno Kessler Foundation (Trento, Italy), a visitor in the University of Trento (Trento, Italy), a **soon-to-be PhD Candidate** within the Mathematics 41st cycle (starting in November 2025) at University of Trento and Bruno Kessler Foundation (Trento, Italy), and a research collaborator in AALTO University (Helsinki, Finland)

My research interests include **statistics, machine learning and mathematical models**, and employing these subjects to investigate real-world phenomena, especially in the context of **disinformation** and coordinated inauthentic behaviour.
