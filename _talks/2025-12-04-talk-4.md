**Sharing know-how, research lines and career tips: a symposium for early stage researchers**

Presentation of my master's thesis (see [thesis](../talks/2025-09-02-talk-1)) in the context of a symposium for early stage researchers at the University of Verona. The poster focuses on the methodological aspects of my research, with an emphasis on the application of marked temporal point processes for simulating and capturing coordinated behaviour in social media. The symposium aims to provide a platform for early stage researchers to share their work, exchange ideas, and receive feedback from peers and senior researchers in the field.
